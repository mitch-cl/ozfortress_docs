# The LAN Downunder Ruleset
This ruleset has been created in part with CappingTV and ozfortress to service specifically the LAN Downunder and TF2 Summer Brawl events. Rules within this ruleset are strictly for offline specific events/LAN events, and though this ruleset may share similar rules and/or clauses with ozfortress rulesets, the contents are likely different or are not purpose fit. The Global ruleset and Sixes ruleset act as the base for this ruleset, and unless a rule in this ruleset differs from either of the aforementioned rulesets, players will also need to follow what is stated in those rulesets as well.

## 1. LAN Tournaments
### 1.1. Round Robin
In the first portion of the tournament, each team competes against each other once, playing a best-of-one series picked out of a nine (9) map pool (this can be found in our [League Info](/info/map_history/)). This map pool is chosen by the tournament administration prior to the start of the event. Each match is typically expected to last an average of thirty minutes, but team's should always be ready to play longer.

### 1.2. Swiss Stage
Depending on the tournament's size and duration, a Swiss bracket format may replace the Round Robin stage. In the first round, teams will be paired for a single best-of-one match. After these matches, teams will be grouped with others sharing the same win-loss record for the next round. This process will repeat until each team has either achieved three match wins or been eliminated. Tournament administration will pre-select the map for each round before the event begins. While each match is expected to last approximately 30 minutes, teams should be prepared for longer durations if necessary.

### 1.3. Playoffs Stage
In Playoffs, each team competes in a single elimination bracket and starts in the first round (play-ins), playing a best-of-one series picked by tournament administration. From Semi-finals onwards, each match or round is a best-of-three series, picked and banned from the nine (9) map pool found in the Round Robin stage (this can be found in our [League Info section](/info/map_history/)). Playoffs fixtures are almost always expected to last at least thirty minutes per map, for an average runtime of ninety minutes to two hours. Once all but two teams are eliminated, a best-of-five Grand Final series is played, as such teams should expect a runtime of anywhere between two to three hours.

### 1.4. Bracket Systems used
LAN tournament formats vary depending on the length of the event. The first stage of the tournament (depending on signup numbers, format and event length) will typically be run on a Round Robin format, where each team plays each other once. The second stage will typically be run on a single elimination format, where teams play till they're eliminated once.

## 2. Teams
### 2.1. Rosters
#### 2.1.1. Roster Size Requirements/Limits
Teams are expected to have a certain amount of players (does not include any mercenaries) ready to start or continue a match. This expected amount of players differs for each format, and can be seen below.

### 2.2. Mercenaries
Typically mercenery's are prohibited in LAN events unless authorised by a tournament administrator.

## 3. Offline Specific Rules

### 3.2. Setup Time
Players will have a designated time frame prior to each match day to ensure they are properly prepared. Players participating in a LAN event must arrive on-site no later than the time specified by the Referees.

It is expected that Players will resolve any issues during Setup Time within the allotted time and that the Match will begin at the scheduled time. Delays due to setup issues may be permitted, at the sole discretion of Referees. Penalties for tardiness may be assessed at the discretion of Referees. No fewer than five minutes before the Match is scheduled to begin, a Referee will confirm with each Player that their setup is complete. Once all twelve Players in a Match have confirmed completion of setup, Players will be asked to join the game server and join their selected team.

### 3.3. Equipment
Player-provided equipment **must** be submitted to Referees in advance for approval. Referees may disallow the use of specific equipment at their sole discretion for reasons relating to tournament security, safety, operational efficiency/effectiveness or if the equipment features a company or brand competing with ozfortress, the event’s sponsors, or affiliates of ozfortress.

### 3.7. COVID-19
