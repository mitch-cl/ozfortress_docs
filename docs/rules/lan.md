# LAN Ruleset

## Format Specificity
Rules within this ruleset are strictly for offline specific events, and though each ruleset may share the same rules, the contents of each are likely different if they are listed in one of the format rulesets and not the Global Ruleset.

## 1. LAN Tournaments
This ruleset is designed for events such as the LAN Downunder and the TF2 Summer Brawl, which are typically run in short periods (1-2 days).

### 1.1. Round Robin
In the first portion of the tournament, each team competes against each other once, playing a best-of-one series picked out of a nine (9) map pool (this can be found in our [League Info](/info/map_history/)). This map pool is chosen by the tournament administration prior to the start of the season, using mostly poll data. Each match is typically expected to last an average of thirty minutes, but team's should always be ready to play longer.

### 1.2. Playoffs Stage
In Playoffs, each match or round is a Best of 3 map scenario, picked and banned from the nine (9) map pool found in the Round Robin stage (this can be found in our [League Info](/info/map_history/)). Playoffs fixtures are almost always expected to last at least thirty minutes per map, for an average runtime of ninety minutes to two hours. Once all but two teams are eliminated, a best-of-five Grand Final series is played, as such teams should expect a runtime of anywhere between two to three hours.

#### 1.2.1. Playoffs Map Selection (Pick/Bans)
Maps for playoff matches are selected by the captains of each team. This process **must be completed at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled match time**.

##### 1.2.1.1. Sixes Pick/Ban Map Selection
The selection process for a nine map pool (BO3):

1. The **higher seeded** or **home team** will either **choose to ban first or defer**.
2. The **first team** (determined by the result of step one) will **ban a map**.
3. The **second team** will **ban a map**.
4. The **first team** will **ban a map**.
5. The **second team** will **ban a map**.
6. The **first team** will **pick the first map** from the remaining pool.
7. The **second team** will **pick the second map** from the remaining pool.
8. The **first team** will **pick the third/tiebreaker map** from the remaining maps.

For the Premier Grand Final (BO5), the selection process varies as follows:

1. The **higher seeded** or **home team** will either **choose to ban first or defer**.
2. The **first team** (determined by the result of step one) will **ban a map**.
3. The **second team** will **ban a map**.
4. The **first team** will **ban a map**.
5. The **second team** will **ban a map**.
6. The **first team** will **pick the third map** from the remaining pool.
7. The **second team** will **pick the fourth map** from the remaining pool.
8. The **first team** will **pick the tiebreaker map** from the remaining maps.

In the event of a disagreement, the home team will have a preference for team colour. Please note that formats can change for BO3 and BO5 matches. In case of discrepancies between official rules and other sources, the most updated pick-ban order can always be found in match threads.

### 1.3. Bracket Systems used
LAN tournament formats vary depending on the length of the event. The first stage of the tournament (depending on signup numbers, format and event length) will typically be run on a Round Robin format, where each team plays each other once. The second stage will typically be run on a single elimination format, where teams play till they're eliminated once.


## 2. Teams
### 2.1. Rosters
#### 2.1.1. Roster Size Requirements/Limits
- Minimum roster size is six (6).
- Maximum roster size is ten (8).
- Teams should look to have a least one or two substitute players in the event a core player cannot play.

### 2.2. Mercenaries
Typically mercenery's are prohibited in LAN events unless authorised by a tournament administrator.

### 2.3. Team Eligibility Requirements
Teams are expected to have a certain amount of players (does not include any mercenaries) ready to start or continue a match. This expected amount of players differs for each format, and can be seen below.

## 3. Offline Specific Rules

### 3.2. Setup time
Players will have a designated time frame prior to each match day to ensure they are properly prepared. Players participating in a LAN event must arrive on-site no later than the time specified by the Referees.

Referees will inform Players and Teams of their scheduled preparation time frame as part of their Match schedule. Referees may change the schedule at any time. Setup Time is considered to have begun once Players enter the Match Area. Setup is comprised of the following:
- Ensuring the quality of all venue-provided equipment

#### 3.2.5. Once all twelve Players in a Match have confirmed completion of setup, Players will be asked to join the game server and join their selected team.

### 3.3. Equipment

Referees may disallow the use of specific equipment at their sole discretion for reasons relating to tournament security, safety, operational efficiency/effectiveness or if the equipment features a company or brand competing with ozfortress, the event’s sponsors, or affiliates of ozfortress. If there are technical problems with the player’s own equipment, Referees may request that the player uses provided equipment as opposed to theirs to avoid delays.

If approved casting organisations would like a player from a team to be part of interviews (short pre/post match interviews and/or longer interview-sessions), a press conference or an autograph, photograph or video-session, then the team must nominate one or more players to participate. Some events will have a media day, where participants will be photographed, filmed and interviewed by the media crew for the event presentation. Players will receive a media schedule beforehand to be informed about the nature, duration and schedule of any activities of this kind that take more than 5 minutes. Players of the winning team have to stay in the tournament area for the winners ceremony and interview after the Grand Final.

### 3.6. Food, Drinks, Smoking and Behaviour
Players are allowed to have beverages, but if nothing else has been announced, it is forbidden to bring or eat any food in the Match Area. Smoking and vaping is also strictly prohibited inside the venue. Offensive language is forbidden. Players and coaches are not allowed to look at any screens in the arena that may provide them an advantage in the game. Any violations can be punished with infraction points.

### 3.7. COVID-19
As the situation can always change, we are keeping tabs on any restrictions that may apply at both state and federal level. If an event is cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions, all teams will be refunded the entry fee. Players agree by attending LAN events that you have received at least two doses of an Australian Government approved COVID-19 vaccine prior to entry. You additionally agree that you have received no positive COVID-19 tests within the last week.

If a Player is showing signs or symptoms related to the coronavirus, they will be subject to all procedures, as covered by the state's health and safety protocols. If a player is rendered unable to play or continue to play because of a lack of medical clearance, or if the team is unable to field a roster that is compliant with the rulebook, the team shall forfeit the tournament.

## 4. Format
Sixes teams are expected to play with six players at all times within an official match. If a team cannot field field enough players from their roster and mercenaries, teams are permitted to play with five players, with the opposing team permitted to keep their full six player roster. Teams cannot play with fewer than five players, otherwise they will be automatically disqualified and subsequently forfeited. Teams must still observe mercenary rules and limits.

### 4.1. Class Limits
The following class limits are required on all official match servers. Breaking these limits in any way that impacts a match is considered cheating, and depending on administrator discretion could lead to a match result overturn.

```
tf_tournament_classlimit_scout 2
tf_tournament_classlimit_soldier 2
tf_tournament_classlimit_pyro 1
tf_tournament_classlimit_demoman 1
tf_tournament_classlimit_heavy 1
tf_tournament_classlimit_engineer 1

### 4.2. Unlocks / Whitelist
The whitelist can be found on whitelist by [clicking here](https://whitelist.tf/ozfortress_6v6), or under the ozfortress menu on whitelist.tf.

Changes to weapons or their mechanics, the addition of new cosmetics or taunts, or removal of certain properties will see the weapon / cosmetic / taunt banned for the remainder of that season. New items are automatically blocked by the whitelist, but in the event something is changed as stated above, ozfortress will post an announcement regarding it.

### 4.3. Server configs & usage
Configs for any seasonal league or tournament can be found on the Server Configs page, and any associated guides will be linked on that page.
