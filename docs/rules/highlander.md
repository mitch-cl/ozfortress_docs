# Highlander Ruleset

## Format Specificity
Rules within this ruleset apply strictly to the Highlander (HL). While each ruleset may share rules, the specific contents are likely different when listed within a format-specific ruleset rather than the Global ruleset. Please note this ruleset is authored for our Highlander seasonal leagues, but in the event it is linked on an ozfortress-run Highlander tournament, rules mentioning seasonal specifics should be ignored. If you are not sure whether or not a rule applies to a Highlander tournament run by us, please reach out.

## 1. Highlander Format
### 1.1. Class Limits
The following class limits are required on for official matches. Breaking these limits in any way is considered cheating, and depending on administrator discretion could lead to league penalties or a match result being overturned.

- 1 Scout
- 1 Soldier
- 1 Pyro
- 1 Demoman
- 1 Heavy
- 1 Engineer
- 1 Medic
- 1 Sniper
- 1 Spy

!!! Note "Please Note"
    Server configurations allow for more than one Scout to allow players to effectively swap classes without the need for swapping to spectator; swapping to spectator is not allowed as outlined [here](/rules/global/#86-spectators).

### 1.2. Whitelist (Unlocks)
The Highlander whitelist can be found [here](https://whitelist.tf/ozfortress_hl).

### 1.3. Stopwatch
Payload and Attack/Defend maps are played using a Stopwatch. There is no timelimit for Stopwatch maps other than what is set by the Stopwatch timer itself.

#### 1.3.1. Regular Season Stopwatch
During the regular season, stopwatch maps are played to one round, with each side attacking and defending once. 

#### 1.3.2. Upper Division Playoffs Stopwatch
For Upper division playoffs, Stopwatch is played using the A.B.B.A system (ABBA). In ABBA, Stopwatch maps are played in a best of three scenario, requiring one team to win two full rounds. Two upper division teams can agree to play to one round instead of ABBA.

#### 1.3.3. Lower Division Playoffs Stopwatch
For Lower division playoffs, Stopwatch is played to one round. Two lower divison teams can agree to play ABBA as described in [1.3.2. Upper Division Playoffs Stopwatch]().

### 1.4. King of the Hill (KOTH)
In Highlander, all King of the Hill (KOTH) maps follow a best of five win condition with a three minute team clock. Different KOTH maps may vary slightly on overtime timers, locked and unlocked timers (when the point is not able to be captured at the start and when it unlocks) as these are built into the map.

### 1.5. Control Point (5CP)
#### 1.5.1. 5CP map timer
The map timer for 5CP maps is 30 minutes. 

#### 1.5.2. 5CP round timer
The round timer for 5CP maps is 10 minutes.

#### 1.5.3. 5CP round win limit
The round timer for 5CP maps is 5 rounds.

### 1.5.4. 5CP map draws
In the event that two teams draw at the end of a 5CP map, they are required to play a golden cap. Golden Cap rounds are played till the first capture of the last point with no time limit. You can find more details on the Server Configs page [here](/info/server_configs/#golden-cap).

## 2. Highlander Playoffs
### 2.1. Playoff Match Format
Playoff matches are exclusively played as a best of three (BO3) series with maps selected from the map pool.

#### 2.2.1. Playoff Map Selection Order
For Playoff matches, the **higher seeded team** is awarded the final map pick.

The **higher seeded team** is **Team A**. They can, however, choose to be **Team B** by deferring the first ban. **Maps must be played in the order in which they were picked.**

##### Pick/Ban Order
1. **Team A bans** a map
2. **Team B bans** a map
3. **Team A picks** a map
4. **Team B picks** a map
5. **Team B bans** a map
6. **Team A picks** a map

| **Team A** | Ban |     | Pick |      | Ban |      |
|------------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|------|
| **Team B** |     | Ban |      | Pick |     | Pick |
